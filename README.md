# MovieCenter
This is a Movie Website template. It is not a complete website but I would like to show the theme of the front side. It has three main pages. In the main page, I used swipper api. In the first page, simple javascript background slide with using arrays. 
I couldn't fix the responsivity.

Swipper api link;
https://swiperjs.com/api/

And there it is;
